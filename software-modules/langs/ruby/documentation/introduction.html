      <h2>Ruby 2.7.4  Standard Library Documentation</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>
        Welcome to the Ruby Standard Library Documentation collection, brought to you by
         <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org">Ruby-doc</a>.  Whether you are
        browsing online or offline, we hope that your use of Ruby's standard library will
        become more productive as a result of this effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org">Ruby-doc</a> is a project dedicated to creating
        and collecting documentation on Ruby.  
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://stdlib-doc.rubyforge.org">stdlib-doc</a> is a <a
          href="http://www.rubyforge.org">RubyForge</a> project that converts Ruby
        source code into this documentation you are looking at.  
      </p>

      <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>

      <p>
        Each package in the Ruby standard library (found in <tt>lib/</tt> directory of the
        Ruby source code, or <tt>lib/ruby/1.<i>x</i>/</tt> of a Ruby installation) has
        been run through RDoc and the results have been collected here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org">ruby-doc</a> volunteers and library authors
        add comments to the Ruby source code repository, and it is those comments that RDoc
        captures for display in this collection.  As there are many libraries and few
        volunteers, this is a long task.  
      </p>
        <h3>Credits</h3>
        <p>
          Much of the documentation itself has been created by Gavin Sinclair, William Webber, Lyle
          Johnson, James Edward Gray II, and library authors.  Individual library files
          usually have code and documentation credits.  
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org">ruby-doc.org</a> was created and is maintained by James Britt/Neurogami.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gavin Sinclair wrote the software (<tt>ruby stdlib-doc.rb gendoc --all</tt>) to
          generate this webpage (thanks, <a href="http://www.brain-tokyo.jp/research/amrita/">Amrita</a>!).
        </p>
        <p><a herf='http://jamesbritt.com'>James Britt</a> did some later hacking to bring some things up to date and to
          have it play nice with different Ruby versions.</p>
        <p>
          Thanks to Dave Thomas for RDoc, without which this project would be impossible.
