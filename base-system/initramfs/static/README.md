How to rebuild these static binaries:
- using buildroot scripts <buildroot.uclibc.org>
- unpack buildroot in /usr/src
- copy busybox config (generated by busybox bbconfig) to /usr/src/buildroot-source/package/busybox/busybox-1.20.x.config
- cd /usr/src/buildroot-sources
- make menuconfig
- configure buildroot to compile static libraries, set target processor architecture, and so on
- add packages to buildroot, such as httpfs2-enhanced, dynfilefs, etc.
- some manual tweaking is necessary, sorry about not commenting it here
- make
- find static binaries in /usr/src/buildroot-sources/output/target/bin/ etc
