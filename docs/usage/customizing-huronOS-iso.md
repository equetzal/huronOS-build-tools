# Customizing the huronOS ISO
There is many reasons for why someone would like to customize an huronOS immutable ISO. Some of the ideas could be setting a root password, changing the default wallpaper, changing the default directives to fallback, or even change de behavior of the sync manager.

To customize the huronOS ISO, you have 2 options: Create a system layer (`.hsl`) with only your delta changes or build the huronOS by yourself by modifying the huronOS repositories. In this page we will only cover the first option, so, for the second option please referee to the [how to create a build](../development/how-to-create-a-build.md) page.

## Creating an huronOS system layer
To understand what a system layer is, please firstly read about what the *Union Filesystems* are, and what an *SquashFS* file is. This are concepts necessaries to be confident on creating this system layer.  
After this, it's recommended to read about [how the system layers work](../design/how-the-system-layers-work.md) to better understand how those concepts are used inside huronOS.  

After this, please select what files do you want to include in a new system layer, this are regularly the deltas between the layer `04-shared-libs.hsl` and the state you want to archive. In certain cases is better to just use `savechanges` and then remove all the unnecessary files. Other times is better to create a fake root and only include the files you want. This last option is considered to be a better practice as you have more control of what you want to include or not.  

Some examples on how to use the first method are available in [the software scripts](../../software-modules/), and for the second method you can follow the example of [how to change the root password](root-access.md) but instead of adding the `shadow` file, use your preferred files.

## Add your system layer to the ISO
To add your own system layer to the ISO of huronOS you will be needing to unpack the ISO and then repack it with your added contents. To do this, you will be needing the [make-iso.sh](../../base-system/tools/make-iso/make-iso.sh) utility.

Create a directory with the following structure inside of it:
```txt
dir/
├── iso-data/
└── make-iso.sh
```

Now, copy all the contents of the ISO image you used to modify huronOS.
```bash
mkdir -p /media/iso
mount huronOS-b2023.0023-amd64.iso /media/iso

mkdir -p ./test-lab/iso-data
cp -rf /media/iso/* ./test-lab/iso-data/
```

After copying the content to `iso-data/` add your custom files to the image, either `.hsl` files on the `huronOS/base/` directory or `.hsm` modules on `huronOS/software/`.

Then, configure the `make-iso.sh` script by opening it with an editor and edit the following variables:
```bash
ISO_DATA=""	# Where the ISO data will be taken from, e.g. ./iso-data
ISO_TOOL="" # The tool for making the ISO, must be on PATH. e.g. mkisofs
ISO_OUTPUT="" # How the resulting ISO will be named
CHECKSUMS="./checksums" # Leave it as it is
EFI_DIR="./EFI" # Leave it as it is
BOOT_DIR="./boot" # Leave it as it is
HURONOS_DIR="./huronOS" " # Leave it as it is
```

Finally run the script with `./make-iso.sh`. Please make sure to give execute permissions to the file. As a result of this, you'll have generated with an ISO file on the output path you configured and a `.sha256` checksum file.

> **Note:** For the installer to work properly, the ISO file must be created with the `make-iso.sh` tool as this tool calculates the checksums for all the contents of the ISO, which are then needed by the installer in order to validate installation is successfully performed.
