# Where to store the directives file
Since the directives file in the end is a text file, you can store the directives 
- Online: Wherever you can store text files like gist, pastebin or a public server (on any case you'll have to pass the url with the raw option if available so only the text is retrieved and nothing else).
- Local server: If every computer is in the network, you can store the file in a local server and retrieve the file locally.
