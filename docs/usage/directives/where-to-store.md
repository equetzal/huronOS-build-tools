# Where to store the directives file
Since the directives file is a text file after all, you can store the directives 
- Online: Wherever you can store text files like gist, pastebin or a public server (in any case you'll have to pass the url with the raw option if available so only the text is retrieved and nothing else).
- At A Local Server: If every computer is in the network, you can store the file in a local server and retrieve the file locally. (e.g. Apache Server)
